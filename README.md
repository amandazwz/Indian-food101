1- I think it would be a good way to evaluate the nutritional value of the Indian food listed in the Indian food dataset and determine whether they are **healthy or not**

2- I want to combine the nutritional data of each dish to the nutritional value to the food data set

3- And we set a specific value like cholesterol or calories to group healthy or unhealthy food dishes
