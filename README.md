# Indian-food101
1- I compared the correlation between the nutrition value between indian food dishes and the food data set. and determine whether they are **healthy or not**

2- I combine the nutritional data of each dish to the nutritional value to the food data set to make an analysis based on vegetarian and non-vegetarian food.

3- I set a specific value for cholesterol and calories to group healthy or unhealthy food dishes.

4- I made analysis based on the flavor popular in india and conclusion on the health profile in different regions.
